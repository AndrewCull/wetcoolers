        <h1>How it all began.</h1>
        <p>Water Engineering Technologies began in 1996, and we pioneered bottle-less water dispensers with our first installs in 1998. In 2002, the company was asked by Alaska Airlines to figure out an impossible challenge - remove arsenic from the water
          in Yakutat, Alaska airport. With less than 60 days to complete the project and under threat of state shutdown, the team completed the challenge and our reputation for providing the cleanest water to almost anywhere, was born.</p>
