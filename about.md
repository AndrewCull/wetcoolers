<h1>We are Your Water Experts</h1>
<h2 class="subheading" style="line-height: 1.25; margin-bottom: 10px;"><small>From large water systems to office coolers, our value is in our service and expertise.</small></h2>

<p>Water Engineering Technologies began in 1996, and we pioneered bottle-less water dispensers with our first installs in 1998. In 2002, the company was asked by Alaska Airlines to figure out an impossible challenge - remove arsenic from the water in Yakutat, Alaska airport. With less than 60 days to complete the project and under threat of state shutdown, the team completed the challenge and our reputation for providing the cleanest water to almost anywhere, was born. We've since completed many more similar projects as well as developed solutions for municipal, office, healthcare facilities, and health clubs and others.</p>

<p>As our customer, we are committed to providing you with the highest performance water purification systems in the marketplace combining our product expertise with best-in-class service. We'll install sleek, modern-looking, bottle-less water system anywhere in your building at a fraction of the cost of bottled water without the health issues associated with bottled water dispensers. Furthermore, we can install these systems anywhere in your building.</p>

<p>Using technology previously only available in expensive healthcare water systems, our bottle-less water purification coolers are the most effective way to provide fresh, pure, oxygenated drinking water to your employees. No longer will you have to deal with the high cost and hassle of bottled water delivery services.</p>
