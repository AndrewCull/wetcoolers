<h2 class="subheading" style="line-height: auto;"><small>From large water systems to office coolers, our value is in our service and expertise.</small></h2>
<p>In 2003, our founders were asked by Alaska Airlines to figure out an impossible challenge - make a small Alaskan airport water safe to drink. With less than 60 days to complete the project, under threat of FAA shutdown, the team completed the challenge and Water Engineering Technologies was born.</p>


<p>Our commitment to providing you with the highest performance water purification systems in the marketplace. We are now able to install sleek, modern-looking, bottle-less water system at a fraction of the cost of bottled water without any of the health issues associated with bottled water dispensers.</p>

<p>Using technology previously only available in expensive healthcare water systems, our bottle-less water purification coolers are the most effective way to provide fresh, pure, oxygenated drinking water to your employees. No longer will you have to deal with the high cost and hassle of bottled water delivery services.</p>
